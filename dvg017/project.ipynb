    "You are to create a text-based game where both skill and luck are required to win. The user gets locked in a house with zombies and the only way out is to answer math questions correctly and choose the right door to avoid being eaten by zombies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user selects the number of questions (12 - 26)\n",
    "The user chooses the mathematical operation to be used, select from multiplication, integer division and modulus.\n",
    "If the operation is multiplication (factor * table = product), a table (2 - 12) is selected,\n",
    "for integer division (dividend // divisor = quotient), a divisor (2 - 5) is selected, and for modulus (dividend % divisor = remainder), a divisor (2 - 5) is chosen.\n",
    "The selection of table or divisor is done once, and then all questions will be based on that table/divisor.\n",
    "Each question consists of two parts: first, the user must answer a math question correctly, and then choose the right door to avoid the zombies.\n",
    "All mathematical questions use the selected operation.\n",
    "The mathematical question for multiplication should be, factor * table, where the factor is randomly generated (0 - 12).\n",
    "For integer division, the mathematical question should be, dividend // divisor, where the dividend is randomly generated (0 - 12).\n",
    "For modulus, the mathematical question should be, dividend % divisor, where the dividend is randomly generated (0 - 12).\n",
    "\n",
    "The user guesses what the product/quotient/remainder is.\n",
    "The same mathematical question should not appear more than necessary. For example, if the operation is multiplication and the number of questions is 13 or fewer, the same question should not appear more than once.\n",
    "If the number of questions is between 14 - 26, the same question should not appear more than twice.\n",
    "And similarly for integer division and modulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game begins with the user answering a math question. If the user answers correctly, they must choose a door from several and avoid the zombies behind one of them. The number of doors corresponds to the number of questions, e.g., if the number of questions is 12, the first time the choice of door is presented there are 12 doors, with the zombies behind one of them. For question two, the number of doors is 11, and so on, until the penultimate question when the number of doors is two.\n",
    "Regardless of the number of doors, the zombies are always hiding behind one of them.\n",
    "On the last question, there is no question about doors, but just answering the question correctly is enough to win.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user's input can be assumed to be integers, but when choosing a door, check that the integer is within the correct range.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user answers a mathematical question incorrectly or chooses the wrong door, they lose the game. The user wins the game when all questions are answered correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user should always know how far they have come in the game, i.e., how many questions they have answered correctly so far and how many questions remain.\n",
    "When the user guesses the right door, i.e., where the zombies were not hiding, the user should be informed about which door the zombies were behind.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user doesn't win, a question about a new game should be presented, and if the answer is yes, the same conditions should be used regarding the choice of the number of questions, operation, and table/divisor.\n",
    "If the user wins, a question about a new game should be presented, and if the answer is yes, a new question should be made about the number of questions, operation, and table/divisor."
